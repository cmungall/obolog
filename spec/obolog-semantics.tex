\section{Obolog Semantics}

This section specifies the semantics of the core Obolog language in terms of first order logic axioms.

Each Obolog predicate is listed, along with:

\begin{clist}
\item A short natural language description of that predicate
\item Examples of actual or potential use of this predicate in OBO ontologies
\item Properties of this predicate, described in the Obolog language itself
\item Axioms and theorems pertaining to that predicate
\end{clist}

The specification is entirely in terms of constructs that can be
expressed in Common Logic. We import some predicates from the OBO
Relation Ontology (RO), specifically:

\begin{clist}
\item instance\_of
\item is\_a
\item exists\_at
\end{clist}
