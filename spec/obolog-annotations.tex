\section{Obolog Annotations}

Note: here \emph{annotation} means something different than in OWL (although there are similarities).

In Obolog, annotations are contextually true sentences, typically
supported by various kinds of provenance and metadata.

Annotation sentences are reified using the function \pr{that}

\subsection{Obolog semantics}

The function \pr{that} is undefined, so annotations have no entailments.

Optionally, this function can be translated to unreified form so that
the sentence is globally true. This is non-normative.

\subsection{Obolog-A semantics}

Obolog-A is defined using the KR language IKL, an extension of Common
Logic. The semantics of \pr{that} are as for IKL.
